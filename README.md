## Ker-NelBot
Ker-NelBot is a Discord bot written in C# using the DSharpPlus library. It is designed to be a simple bot that can be easily modified to suit your needs. It is also themed as a Valorant bot after my favorite agent, Kay/O.

## How to set it up
1) Clone the repository.
2) Open the solution file in your IDE.
3) Download the required [packages](https://github.com/carterawebb/Ker-NelBot#Packages).
4) Create a new Discord application and bot account [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
5) Copy the bot token.
6) Create a file named exactly "config.json" file at `\bin\Debug` that has your Discord Bot token and your desired prefix.
7) Build the solution, or run it on a server.
